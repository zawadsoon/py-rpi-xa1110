# But how do I know it works?
Um... Fistly if LED on Device is endabled and blink (It is hard to miss blue LED) thats means your GPS have a satellite fix. Second, when you see something most interesting than zeros it also means your GPS have a satellite fix.
In my case I have to go outside to be in range of the satellites. Usually I have to wait about 1-2 min to find sattelites (I do not have antenna)
